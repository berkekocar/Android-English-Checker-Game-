# Android-English-Checker-Game
I created an English checker mobile game with Custom View via Google's Android SDK. 
Notes about the program before start. 

-If the project has an execution error it might be because of the gradle sync. These kind of case it is better to rebuild the project then run it. 
- For selecting starts with player 1, there is a bug if you select the item sometimes it does not allow you to deselect. 
- For capture it is necessary to press on to the enemy checker.
